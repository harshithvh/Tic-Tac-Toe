# Description

---

A game is an activity among two or more independent decision-makers seeking to achieve their objectives in some limiting context. Games in medieval times required at least two players. This is a problem, as you are dependent on other players. This problem was solved by modern video games, in which developers made games for single players. But the opponents in those games were not too smart and thus games didn’t have a wider audience. Games of today use some kind of bots with intelligence as opponents. The inclusion of these AI bots made the games engaging and they are loved by wider audiences. Today we will see how these bots are made, and we will create an AI bot for a two-player game (Tic-Tac-Toe).

# Different ways to create game bots

---

There are multiple ways to create bots for games like:

1. Making Random moves

Moves will be artificial but will lack intelligence thus the game will not be engaging

2. Finding Probability of Winning, Losing, and Draw with all possible moves

In this, we use data. the bot will play games in simulation and calculate the number of wins, losses and draw matches and will perform the move with more win% or draw%.
